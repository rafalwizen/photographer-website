## Custom solution
In order for the website owner to easily add new galleries and photos without a special interface, the ability to provide gallery settings in the [galleriesConfig.json](https://github.com/rafalwizen/photographer-website/blob/master/config/galleriesConfig.json) file has been implemented:

![Screen 3](screenshots/screenshot_3.jpg)
- name - description of the gallery on the thumbnail
- thumbnail - file name of the gallery thumbnail
- folder - folder name
- numberOfImages - number of images in the gallery

![Screen 4](screenshots/screenshot_4.jpg)

Each image in the gallery must be named "N-small.jpg", where N is the next natural number
